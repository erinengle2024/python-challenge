# python-challenge

Welcome to my submission for the Python-Challenge in week 3 of the Data Analytics bootcamp. This project was completed as part of the curriculum to showcase my proficiency in Python coding, particularly in the context of data analytics.

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, our objective was to analyze two separate CSV files—one containing bank data and the other polling data—extracting specific criteria from each. Below, you'll find the detailed requirements of the challenge.

## Resources Used
I primarily referenced the following challenges for my code:

- The Write CSV challenge
- The Kid in the Candy Store Challenge
- The US Census Challenge
- The Graduation Functions Challenge

These challenges, in addition to the other challenges provided, were helpful in teaching us the following:

- Importing files for reference
- Importing a library
- Looping through the referenced CSV file
- Separating values using a delimiter
- Printing the results to the terminal 
- Using conditional statements within the for loop

## Additional Resources
For syntax that I was not familiar with, such as formating percentages, and returning values, I used resources such as the Xpert Learning Assistant, provided by UC Berkely Bootcamp, W3Schools, and ChatGPT.
